* Twitch API
  * used for getting player count, streamer count, link to twitch game page, and top stream itself being displayed
  * https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/
  
* IsThereAnyDeal API
  * used for getting best deals for a Steam game from other sites not related to Steam, and specific shop details for each game
